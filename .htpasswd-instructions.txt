INSTRUCTIONS FOR CREATING .htpasswd
====================================

Since we need a properly encrypted password, you have these options:

1. Use an online htpasswd generator:
   - Go to: https://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/
   - Username: admin
   - Password: NameNeg-1!!@@!!
   - Copy the generated line

2. The line will look something like:
   admin:$apr1$xxxxx$xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

3. Create a file named .htpasswd with that single line

4. Upload it to your SiteGround root directory:
   /home/customer/www/largerthanlifecomics.com/.htpasswd

IMPORTANT: The .htpasswd file should be ABOVE your public_html directory for security!

After uploading .htpasswd, the admin area will be protected with HTTP Basic Auth.
